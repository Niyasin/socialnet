# socialnet
A mini social network web app made with node,express,react and mongoDB.

## How to Run
use `node app` to start server and open http://localhost:8080 in the browser.
```bash
node app
```
the above scrip starts the server and uses production build from the `client/build` folder

Folder named 'client' includes the react frontend. the react development server can be started  separately by using `npm start` from client folder.

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

to rebuild optimized production build that works with the full stack application use `npm run build`
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```
